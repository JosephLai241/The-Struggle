## Introduction
 
I have been applying to *tons* of companies in attempt to secure a job before I graduate from college. The number is so high, it has become hard to keep track of every single place as well as where my application stands in the interview process. I decided to make a Python command-line tool in attempt to help me keep track of my applications and the status of each one. I thought the tool was pretty good, so I put it on here. Thank you for trying this program and I hope it will help you keep track of your applications as well.
